# üñ• PC Activity Logger ‚Üí Google Sheets

This script logs **process activity** and **active window titles** from your computer directly into a **Google Sheet** in real-time.  
It works on **Windows** and **Linux** (with minor setup differences).

---

## üì¶ Features
- Logs every new process with:
  - Timestamp
  - Process name
  - Active window title
- Saves data to **Google Sheets** using the Google Drive API
- Can be **remotely stopped** by typing `STOP` in cell `D1` of the Google Sheet
- Cross-platform (Windows & Linux)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

#### **Windows**
```bash
pip install psutil gspread oauth2client pywin32
sudo apt install xdotool wmctrl
pip install psutil gspread oauth2client
3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Your Google Sheet

    Create a new Google Sheet and name it PC Activity Logger (or update the name in the script).

    Leave it blank ‚Äî the script will automatically add headers.

    The script will create:

    Time | Process Name | Window Title

    Cell D1 will contain the status ‚Äî change it to STOP to stop the script remotely.

üöÄ Usage
Windows

Use the Windows version of the script:

import psutil
import win32gui
...

Run it:

python activity_logger_windows.py

Linux

Use the Linux version of the script:

import psutil
import subprocess
...

Run it:

python activity_logger_linux.py

üõë Stopping the Script

    You can stop it remotely by changing cell D1 in the Google Sheet to:

STOP

Or locally with:

    Ctrl + C

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

    On Linux, xdotool must be installed or active window titles will not be detected.

    On Windows, pywin32 must be installed for window title detection.

    The Google Sheets API has a rate limit ‚Äî avoid excessively short update intervals.

üìú License

This project is free to use and modify for personal purposes.

If you want, I can also **merge** the Windows & Linux code into one **single cross-platform script** so that this README only needs one usage section.  
That way you don‚Äôt have to maintain two separate files.
